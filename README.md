# Data_Driven_Strategic_Making

## Amazon Product Co-purchasing Network

### Introduction

This project revolves around analyzing an Amazon product co-purchasing network. The dataset in focus represents the co-purchasing relationships between various products available on Amazon's platform. In this network, each product is represented as a node, and the connections or edges between nodes signify that these products were frequently purchased together by Amazon customers.

The objective of this project is to leverage data-driven strategies to gain valuable insights from the co-purchasing patterns within the Amazon ecosystem. By harnessing the power of data analysis and network science, we aim to uncover significant product associations, customer preferences, and potentially discover strategic opportunities for Amazon.

### Key Objectives

- Explore the co-purchasing network to identify product clusters or communities.
- Analyze the frequency and strength of connections between products.
- Discover patterns and trends in customer purchasing behavior.
- Propose data-driven strategies for optimizing product recommendations and marketing efforts.
- Provide insights that can potentially lead to more informed strategic decisions for Amazon.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about the co-purchasing relationships between Amazon products. It includes product IDs, purchase frequency, and other relevant data that will be used for network analysis and strategic decision-making.

### Methodology

The project will employ various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into the co-purchasing network. This includes network analysis, graph algorithms, and data visualization tools to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.
